# SNKRS

Create an Android app that shows a custom view that does the following:

1. Displays a looping carousel (a never-ending merry-go-round with a set number of items)
of cards with images & text, with the middle card(s)
"zoomed" similar to how the OSX dock magnification works.

2. Contains any REST API and display the data returned in a meaningful way. You can use the Github API or a weather or movie database service if you'd like.

For additional context:
#1 is focusing on your ability to animate views and structure the viewing of data.
#2 is focusing on networking and doing something with "loose requirements" If you have any questions, let me know.
Again, this is your chance to show off a bit, so feel free to take whatever time you need.
